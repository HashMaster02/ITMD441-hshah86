                <p>This is the intro page to my ITMD441 class. My name is Hashir Shah and I am a Co-Term in Computer Science and Aritificial Intelligence. I am currently a Junior.</p>
                 <p>
                    My web development experience includes the core technologies HTML, CSS and JavaScript, the frontend framework React, and backend frameworks such as Node and Express. I've built a few web applications that include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Personal Portfolio <a href="https://hashirshah.com/" target="_blank">(here)</a></li>
                        <li>Blog Website <a href="https://www.learnersloft.org/" target="_blank">Learners Loft</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://project-pinboard.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Pinboard</a></li>
                    </ul>
                    On top of these, I have also worked with Firebase and MongoDB.
